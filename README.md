Learning online is slow and not personalized. If you want to quickly understand a topic like “quantum entanglement” or “how transformers work,” you end up watching 45-minute videos, reading long articles, or searching multiple platforms. There was no way to get instant, short, personalized video lessons that match your exact learning level. We imagined a student studying at midnight, a professional preparing for a meeting, or a kid asking a random science question, and all of them getting a simple, clear, personalized video lesson instantly. This became our motivation: Education should adapt to the learner, not the other way around.
